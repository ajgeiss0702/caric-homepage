 Nov. 2015 Mark 1 Award, Ticketmaster, Scottsdale, AZ.
           Nominated by peers as the most valuable contributor to the current iteration.


           --"I am nominating Kevin G for his contribution towards Identity Adapter integration in
            WPS and Ticketing Service which unblocked all the three teams to move forward."
           --"I would like to nominate Kevin Geiss for the Mark 1 Award for the work he has been doing
            for the Identity Adapter and always being available to help/debug WPS issues as they arise.
            Plus he helps everyone on his team get their work done."
           --"Kevin Geiss gets my nomination for this iteration for his dedication in getting the SalesDeck
            Application up in Pre-prod. He went above and beyond to help others and took passion in
            his own work to resolve all the issues that arose in the Pre-prod effort. Thanks Kevin! We
            would not have gotten this far without your dedication and hard work!"
           --"I would like to nominate Kevin for the Mark 1 Award. His work over the last few weeks to
            get the identity adapter integrated with our dependencies has finally paid off! We recognized
            this would be a major challenge right from the get-go, and Kevin stepped up to solve this
            problem."
           --"To get SalesDeck working in Portal, Kevin Geiss took on the tasks of verifying Identity
            Adapter in all environments and got WPS and Ticketing to work with Identity Adapter.
            Kevin is a great team member. He leads by example. He is very easy to work with and
            always ready to help his teammates."
